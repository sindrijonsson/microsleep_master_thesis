## Description
This GitHub repository contains the code for my master thesis project conducted at the Techincal University of Denmark (DTU). The project focused on the development of automatic classification models for microsleep detection by adapting established automatic sleep staging models. This consisted of three different methods of post-processing and thresholding (pat-USleep), fine-tuning via transfer learning (mU-Sleep), and self-supervise learning (mU-SSL).

## Structure of the repository
The model development and evaluation was developed using Python (notebooks) and Matlab. 

At the root of the folder the following files and folders are of interest:
